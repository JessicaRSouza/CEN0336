Jessica by Shel Silverstein

Jessica loves me,
Jessica cares,
Jessica picks me peaches and pears.
Jessica offers me candy and Cokes,
Jessica listens and laughs at me jokes.
Jessica helps when I get in a fight,
Jessica does all my homework at night.
Jessica misses me,
Jessica cries,
Jessica thinks I'm a wonderful guy.
So if you ask me who's my best friend, in a whiz,
I'll stand up and tell you that Jessica is.
But yesterday night I got quite a scare,
I woke up and Jessica just wasn't there.
I called out and reached out for Jessica's hand,
In the darkness where Jessica usually stands.
Then I poked through the house, in each cranny and nook,
But I found somebody each place that I looked.
I searched till I'm tired, and now with the dawn,
There's no doubt about it-
Jessica's gone!
